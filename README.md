Hello, there! Welcome to my github project page. This is my first year working on JAVA based projects like: data visualization, web and app management, and much more! I've been working hard on my customizable neural network project to dive deeper into machine learning and data visualization. At first, the program was pretty straightforward - it created and trained a neural network using the Keras library on a synthetic dataset for binary classification. It also evaluated the model on a test dataset and visualized the decision boundary. 

But guess what? I just released the updated version and it's fulfilling my original goal of being an educational tool! Now, the program prompts users to customize the neural network model with different optimizers, callbacks, and values for hidden layers and learning rate. It even explains the meaning and use case for each feature. And the best part is that it implements the choices and shows how they impact the network's ability to learn. The final visualizations keep track of all the customizations made, so you can see the effects of your choices.

If you're interested, I can share the current repository with you. It includes the updated project code (haywire.py), a requirements.txt file for dependencies, a video demonstration (.mkv file), and samples of the plots. The original project (haywire_example.py) is there too, before I made it customizable. Let me know if you want to check it out!
